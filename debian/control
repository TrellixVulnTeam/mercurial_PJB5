Description: easy-to-use, scalable distributed version control system
 Mercurial is a fast, lightweight Source Control Management system designed
 for efficient handling of very large distributed projects.
 .
 Its features include:
  * O(1) delta-compressed file storage and retrieval scheme
  * Complete cross-indexing of files and changesets for efficient exploration
    of project history
  * Robust SHA1-based integrity checking and append-only storage model
  * Decentralized development model with arbitrary merging between trees
  * High-speed HTTP-based network merge protocol
  * Easy-to-use command-line interface
  * Integrated stand-alone web interface
  * Small Python codebase
 .
 This package contains the architecture dependent files.
