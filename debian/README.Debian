mercurial for Debian
--------------------

For users using mercurial since a long time ;-), I added the convert-repo in
the examples directory. It is needed if you have lod repository that you want
to use with new version of mercurial.
Note: these old versions of mercurial have never been officially packaged in
Debian.
