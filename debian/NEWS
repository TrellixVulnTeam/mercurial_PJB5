mercurial (0.6c-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Previous versions of mercurial can lead to conflicts for internal filenames
  if the repo has both a file 'foo' and a directory 'foo.d'.
  This version of mercurial solves this, however this means that some internal
  files have been renamed.

  If you want to use (commit, clone on same filesystem, ...) a repo created
  with an old version with the new version AND this repo contains directory
  nammed 'foo.d', then you need to deal with it. According to the upstream
  author, something like this should do the trick:

   find .hg -type d -name "*.[di]" -exec echo mv {} {}.hg ";"

  Run this at the top of your working dir. Take out the 'echo' once
  you've confirmed it's finding the right files.

  Also note that 0.6c and older clients should be perfectly compatible
  over the wire, so long as each side has the appropriate directory
  naming.

  But if you use 0.6c to pull into a repo created by 0.6b with changes
  that touch files in an affected directory, you're likely to have
  strange behavior.
