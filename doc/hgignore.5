.SH NAME
hgignore \- syntax for Mercurial ignore files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


The Mercurial system uses a file called \&.hgignore in the root directory of a repository to control its behavior when it finds files that it is not currently managing\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


Mercurial ignores every unmanaged file that matches any pattern in an ignore file\&. The patterns in an ignore file do not apply to files managed by Mercurial\&. To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, see the hg(1) man page\&. Look for the "\-I" and "\-X" options\&.


In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can point to a set of per\-user or global ignore files\&. See the hgrc(5) man page for details of how to configure these files\&. Look for the "ignore" entry in the "ui" section\&.

.SH "SYNTAX"


An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns, with one pattern per line\&. Empty lines are skipped\&. The "#" character is treated as a comment character, and the "\\" character is treated as an escape character\&.


Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes\&. The default syntax used is Python/Perl\-style regular expressions\&.


To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:


syntax: NAME


where NAME is one of the following:

.TP
regexp
Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax\&.

.TP
glob
Shell\-style glob\&.


The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that follow, until another syntax is selected\&.


Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted\&. A glob\-syntax pattern of the form "*\&.c" will match a file ending in "\&.c" in any directory, and a regexp pattern of the form "\\\&.c$" will do the same\&. To root a regexp pattern, start it with "^"\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"


Here is an example ignore file\&.

.nf
# use glob syntax\&.
syntax: glob
.fi

.nf
*\&.elc
*\&.pyc
*~
\&.*\&.swp
.fi

.nf
# switch to regexp syntax\&.
syntax: regexp
^\\\&.pc/
.fi
