.SH NAME
hgrc \- configuration files for Mercurial
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control aspects of its behaviour\&.

.SH "FILES"


Mercurial reads configuration data from three files:

.TP
/etc/mercurial/hgrc
Options in this global configuration file apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&.

.TP
$HOME/\&.hgrc
Per\-user configuration options that apply to all Mercurial commands, no matter from which directory they are run\&. Values in this file override global settings\&.

.TP
<repo>/\&.hg/hgrc
Per\-repository configuration options that only apply in a particular repository\&. This file is not version\-controlled, and will not get transferred during a "clone" operation\&. Values in this file override global and per\-user settings\&.

.SH "SYNTAX"


A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted\&.

.nf
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.fi


Each line contains one entry\&. If the lines that follow are indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry\&.


Leading whitespace is removed from values\&. Empty lines are skipped\&.


The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section\&.


Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments\&.

.SH "SECTIONS"


This section describes the different sections that may appear in a Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their possible values\&.

.TP
decode/encode
Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin\&. This would typically be used for newline processing or other localization/canonicalization of files\&.

.nf
Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command\&.
The command must accept data on stdin and return the transformed
data on stdout\&.
.fi

.nf
Example:
.fi

.nf
[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*\&.gz = gunzip
.fi

.nf
[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir
*\&.gz = gzip
.fi
