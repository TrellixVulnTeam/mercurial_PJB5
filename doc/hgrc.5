.SH NAME
hgrc \- configuration files for Mercurial
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control aspects of its behaviour\&.

.SH "FILES"


Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist\&. The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is installed\&.

.TP
(Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc\&.d/*\&.rc, (Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc
Per\-installation configuration files, searched for in the directory where Mercurial is installed\&. For example, if installed in /shared/tools, Mercurial will look in /shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&.

.TP
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc\&.d/*\&.rc, (Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc, (Windows) C:\\Mercurial\\Mercurial\&.ini
Per\-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial is running\&. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&. Options in these files override per\-installation options\&.

.TP
(Unix) $HOME/\&.hgrc
(Windows) C:\\Documents and Settings\\USERNAME\\Mercurial\&.ini Per\-user configuration file, for the user running Mercurial\&. Options in this file apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\&. Options in this file override per\-installation and per\-system options\&.

.TP
(Unix, Windows) <repo>/\&.hg/hgrc
Per\-repository configuration options that only apply in a particular repository\&. This file is not version\-controlled, and will not get transferred during a "clone" operation\&. Options in this file override options in all other configuration files\&.

.SH "SYNTAX"


A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted\&.

.nf
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.fi


Each line contains one entry\&. If the lines that follow are indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry\&.


Leading whitespace is removed from values\&. Empty lines are skipped\&.


The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section\&.


Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments\&.

.SH "SECTIONS"


This section describes the different sections that may appear in a Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their possible values\&.

.TP
decode/encode
Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin\&. This would typically be used for newline processing or other localization/canonicalization of files\&.

.nf
Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command\&.
Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
root\&.  For example, to match any file ending in "\&.txt" in the root
directory only, use the pattern "*\&.txt"\&.  To match any file ending
in "\&.c" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**\&.c"\&.
.fi

.nf
The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or
"tempfile:"\&.  If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default\&.
.fi

.nf
A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the
transformed data on stdout\&.
.fi

.nf
Pipe example:
.fi

.nf
[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*\&.gz = pipe: gunzip
.fi

.nf
[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it's the default)
*\&.gz = gzip
.fi

.nf
A "tempfile:" command is a template\&.  The string INFILE is replaced
with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
filtered by the command\&.  The string OUTFILE is replaced with the
name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be
written by the command\&.
.fi

.nf
NOTE: the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
strange effects\&.  In particular, if you are doing line ending
conversion on Windows using the popular dos2unix and unix2dos
programs, you *must* use the tempfile mechanism, as using pipes will
corrupt the contents of your files\&.
.fi

.nf
Tempfile example:
.fi

.nf
[encode]
# convert files to unix line ending conventions on checkin
**\&.txt = tempfile: dos2unix \-n INFILE OUTFILE
.fi

.nf
[decode]
# convert files to windows line ending conventions when writing
# them to the working dir
**\&.txt = tempfile: unix2dos \-n INFILE OUTFILE
.fi

.TP
hooks
Commands that get automatically executed by various actions such as starting or finishing a commit\&. Multiple commands can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the action\&. Overriding a site\-wide hook can be done by changing its value or setting it to an empty string\&.

.nf
Example \&.hg/hgrc:
.fi

.nf
[hooks]
# do not use the site\-wide hook
commit =
commit\&.email = /my/email/hook
commit\&.autobuild = /my/build/hook
.fi
