.SH NAME
hgrc \- configuration files for Mercurial
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control aspects of its behaviour\&.

.SH "FILES"


Mercurial reads configuration data from two files:

.TP
$HOME/\&.hgrc
Global configuration options that apply to all Mercurial commands, no matter where they are run\&.

.TP
<repo>/\&.hg/hgrc
Per\-repository configuration options that only apply in a particular repository\&. This file is not version\-controlled, and will not get transferred during a "clone" operation\&. Values in this file override global values\&.

.SH "SYNTAX"


A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted\&.

.nf
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.fi


Each line contains one entry\&. If the lines that follow are indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry\&.


Leading whitespace is removed from values\&. Empty lines are skipped\&.


The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section\&.


Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments\&.

.SH "SECTIONS"


This section describes the different sections that may appear in a Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their possible values\&.
