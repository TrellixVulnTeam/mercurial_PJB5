.SH "NAME"
hgrc - configuration files for Mercurial
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
The Mercurial system uses a set of configuration files to control aspects of its behaviour\.
.sp
.SH "FILES"
Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist\. The names of these files depend on the system on which Mercurial is installed\.
.PP
(Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc\.d/*\.rc, (Unix) <install\-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-installation configuration files, searched for in the directory where Mercurial is installed\. For example, if installed in /shared/tools, Mercurial will look in /shared/tools/etc/mercurial/hgrc\. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\.
.RE
.PP
(Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc\.d/*\.rc, (Unix) /etc/mercurial/hgrc, (Windows) C:\eMercurial\eMercurial\.ini
.RS 4
Per\-system configuration files, for the system on which Mercurial is running\. Options in these files apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\. Options in these files override per\-installation options\.
.RE
.PP
(Unix) $HOME/\.hgrc, (Windows) C:\eDocuments and Settings\eUSERNAME\eMercurial\.ini, (Windows) $HOME\eMercurial\.ini
.RS 4
Per\-user configuration file, for the user running Mercurial\. Options in this file apply to all Mercurial commands executed by any user in any directory\. Options in this file override per\-installation and per\-system options\. On Windows system, one of these is chosen exclusively according to definition of HOME environment variable\.
.RE
.PP
(Unix, Windows) <repo>/\.hg/hgrc
.RS 4
Per\-repository configuration options that only apply in a particular repository\. This file is not version\-controlled, and will not get transferred during a "clone" operation\. Options in this file override options in all other configuration files\. On Unix, most of this file will be ignored if it doesn\'t belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group\. See the documentation for the trusted section below for more details\.
.RE
.SH "SYNTAX"
A configuration file consists of sections, led by a "[section]" header and followed by "name: value" entries; "name=value" is also accepted\.
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[spam]
eggs=ham
green=
   eggs
.fi
.RE
Each line contains one entry\. If the lines that follow are indented, they are treated as continuations of that entry\.
.sp
Leading whitespace is removed from values\. Empty lines are skipped\.
.sp
The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section\.
.sp
Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide comments\.
.sp
.SH "SECTIONS"
This section describes the different sections that may appear in a Mercurial "hgrc" file, the purpose of each section, its possible keys, and their possible values\.
.PP
decode/encode
.RS 4
Filters for transforming files on checkout/checkin\. This would typically be used for newline processing or other localization/canonicalization of files\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Filters consist of a filter pattern followed by a filter command\.
Filter patterns are globs by default, rooted at the repository
root\.  For example, to match any file ending in "\.txt" in the root
directory only, use the pattern "*\.txt"\.  To match any file ending
in "\.c" anywhere in the repository, use the pattern "**\.c"\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The filter command can start with a specifier, either "pipe:" or
"tempfile:"\.  If no specifier is given, "pipe:" is used by default\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
A "pipe:" command must accept data on stdin and return the
transformed data on stdout\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Pipe example:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[encode]
# uncompress gzip files on checkin to improve delta compression
# note: not necessarily a good idea, just an example
*\.gz = pipe: gunzip
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[decode]
# recompress gzip files when writing them to the working dir (we
# can safely omit "pipe:", because it\'s the default)
*\.gz = gzip
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
A "tempfile:" command is a template\.  The string INFILE is replaced
with the name of a temporary file that contains the data to be
filtered by the command\.  The string OUTFILE is replaced with the
name of an empty temporary file, where the filtered data must be
written by the command\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
NOTE: the tempfile mechanism is recommended for Windows systems,
where the standard shell I/O redirection operators often have
strange effects\.  In particular, if you are doing line ending
conversion on Windows using the popular dos2unix and unix2dos
programs, you *must* use the tempfile mechanism, as using pipes will
corrupt the contents of your files\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Tempfile example:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[encode]
# convert files to unix line ending conventions on checkin
**\.txt = tempfile: dos2unix \-n INFILE OUTFILE
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[decode]
# convert files to windows line ending conventions when writing
# them to the working dir
**\.txt = tempfile: unix2dos \-n INFILE OUTFILE
.fi

.PP
defaults
.RS 4
Use the [defaults] section to define command defaults, i\.e\. the default options/arguments to pass to the specified commands\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The following example makes \'hg log\' run in verbose mode, and
\'hg status\' show only the modified files, by default\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[defaults]
log = \-v
status = \-m
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The actual commands, instead of their aliases, must be used when
defining command defaults\. The command defaults will also be
applied to the aliases of the commands defined\.
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
Settings used when displaying diffs\. They are all boolean and defaults to False\.
.PP

.RS 4
Optional\. Comma\-separated list of blind carbon copy recipients\' email addresses\. Cannot be set interactively\.
.RE
.PP
method
.RS 4
Optional\. Method to use to send email messages\. If value is "smtp" (default), use SMTP (see section "[smtp]" for configuration)\. Otherwise, use as name of program to run that acts like sendmail (takes "\-f" option for sender, list of recipients on command line, message on stdin)\. Normally, setting this to "sendmail" or "/usr/sbin/sendmail" is enough to use sendmail to send messages\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Email example:

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[email]
from = Joseph User <joe\.user@example\.com>
method = /usr/sbin/sendmail

.PP
extensions
.RS 4
Mercurial has an extension mechanism for adding new features\. To enable an extension, create an entry for it in this section\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
If you know that the extension is already in Python\'s search path,
you can give the name of the module, followed by "=", with nothing
after the "="\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Otherwise, give a name that you choose, followed by "=", followed by
the path to the "\.py" file (including the file name extension) that
defines the extension\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Example for ~/\.hgrc:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[extensions]
# (the mq extension will get loaded from mercurial\'s path)
hgext\.mq =
# (this extension will get loaded from the file specified)
myfeature = ~/\.hgext/myfeature\.py
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
format
.RS 4
.PP
usestore
.RS 4
Enable or disable the "store" repository format which improves compatibility with systems that fold case or otherwise mangle filenames\. Enabled by default\. Disabling this option will allow you to store longer filenames in some situations at the expense of compatibility\.
.RE
.RE
.PP
hooks
.RS 4
Commands or Python functions that get automatically executed by various actions such as starting or finishing a commit\. Multiple hooks can be run for the same action by appending a suffix to the action\. Overriding a site\-wide hook can be done by changing its value or setting it to an empty string\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Example \.hg/hgrc:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
[hooks]
# do not use the site\-wide hook
incoming =
incoming\.email = /my/email/hook
incoming\.autobuild = /my/build/hook
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Most hooks are run with environment variables set that give added
useful information\.  For each hook below, the environment variables
it is passed are listed with names of the form "$HG_foo"\.
.fi
.RE
.PP
changegroup
.RS 4
Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or unbundle\. ID of the first new changeset is in $HG_NODE\. URL from which changes came is in $HG_URL\.
.RE
.PP
commit
.RS 4
Run after a changeset has been created in the local repository\. ID of the newly created changeset is in $HG_NODE\. Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2\.
.RE
.PP
incoming
.RS 4
Run after a changeset has been pulled, pushed, or unbundled into the local repository\. The ID of the newly arrived changeset is in $HG_NODE\. URL that was source of changes came is in $HG_URL\.
.RE
.PP
outgoing
.RS 4
Run after sending changes from local repository to another\. ID of first changeset sent is in $HG_NODE\. Source of operation is in $HG_SOURCE; see "preoutgoing" hook for description\.
.RE
.PP
post\-<command>
.RS 4
Run after successful invocations of the associated command\. The contents of the command line are passed as $HG_ARGS and the result code in $HG_RESULT\. Hook failure is ignored\.
.RE
.PP
pre\-<command>
.RS 4
Run before executing the associated command\. The contents of the command line are passed as $HG_ARGS\. If the hook returns failure, the command doesn\'t execute and Mercurial returns the failure code\.
.RE
.PP
prechangegroup
.RS 4
Run before a changegroup is added via push, pull or unbundle\. Exit status 0 allows the changegroup to proceed\. Non\-zero status will cause the push, pull or unbundle to fail\. URL from which changes will come is in $HG_URL\.
.RE
.PP
precommit
.RS 4
Run before starting a local commit\. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed\. Non\-zero status will cause the commit to fail\. Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2\.
.RE
.PP
preoutgoing
.RS 4
Run before computing changes to send from the local repository to another\. Non\-zero status will cause failure\. This lets you prevent pull over http or ssh\. Also prevents against local pull, push (outbound) or bundle commands, but not effective, since you can just copy files instead then\. Source of operation is in $HG_SOURCE\. If "serve", operation is happening on behalf of remote ssh or http repository\. If "push", "pull" or "bundle", operation is happening on behalf of repository on same system\.
.RE
.PP
pretag
.RS 4
Run before creating a tag\. Exit status 0 allows the tag to be created\. Non\-zero status will cause the tag to fail\. ID of changeset to tag is in $HG_NODE\. Name of tag is in $HG_TAG\. Tag is local if $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0\.
.RE
.PP
pretxnchangegroup
.RS 4
Run after a changegroup has been added via push, pull or unbundle, but before the transaction has been committed\. Changegroup is visible to hook program\. This lets you validate incoming changes before accepting them\. Passed the ID of the first new changeset in $HG_NODE\. Exit status 0 allows the transaction to commit\. Non\-zero status will cause the transaction to be rolled back and the push, pull or unbundle will fail\. URL that was source of changes is in $HG_URL\.
.RE
.PP
pretxncommit
.RS 4
Run after a changeset has been created but the transaction not yet committed\. Changeset is visible to hook program\. This lets you validate commit message and changes\. Exit status 0 allows the commit to proceed\. Non\-zero status will cause the transaction to be rolled back\. ID of changeset is in $HG_NODE\. Parent changeset IDs are in $HG_PARENT1 and $HG_PARENT2\.
.RE
.PP
preupdate
.RS 4
Run before updating the working directory\. Exit status 0 allows the update to proceed\. Non\-zero status will prevent the update\. Changeset ID of first new parent is in $HG_PARENT1\. If merge, ID of second new parent is in $HG_PARENT2\.
.RE
.PP
tag
.RS 4
Run after a tag is created\. ID of tagged changeset is in $HG_NODE\. Name of tag is in $HG_TAG\. Tag is local if $HG_LOCAL=1, in repo if $HG_LOCAL=0\.
.RE
.PP
update
.RS 4
Run after updating the working directory\. Changeset ID of first new parent is in $HG_PARENT1\. If merge, ID of second new parent is in $HG_PARENT2\. If update succeeded, $HG_ERROR=0\. If update failed (e\.g\. because conflicts not resolved), $HG_ERROR=1\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Note: it is generally better to use standard hooks rather than the
generic pre\- and post\- command hooks as they are guaranteed to be
called in the appropriate contexts for influencing transactions\.
Also, hooks like "commit" will be called in all contexts that
generate a commit (eg\. tag) and not just the commit command\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Note2: Environment variables with empty values may not be passed to
hooks on platforms like Windows\. For instance, $HG_PARENT2 will
not be available under Windows for non\-merge changesets while being
set to an empty value under Unix\-like systems\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
The syntax for Python hooks is as follows:
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
hookname = python:modulename\.submodule\.callable
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
Python hooks are run within the Mercurial process\.  Each hook is
called with at least three keyword arguments: a ui object (keyword
"ui"), a repository object (keyword "repo"), and a "hooktype"
keyword that tells what kind of hook is used\.  Arguments listed as
environment variables above are passed as keyword arguments, with no
"HG_" prefix, and names in lower case\.
.fi
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
If a Python hook returns a "true" value or raises an exception, this
is treated as failure of the hook\.

.RE
.RE
.PP
server
.RS 4
Controls generic server settings\.
.PP
uncompressed
.RS 4
Whether to allow clients to clone a repo using the uncompressed streaming protocol\. This transfers about 40% more data than a regular clone, but uses less memory and CPU on both server and client\. Over a LAN (100Mbps or better) or a very fast WAN, an uncompressed streaming clone is a lot faster (~10x) than a regular clone\. Over most WAN connections (anything slower than about 6Mbps), uncompressed streaming is slower, because of the extra data transfer overhead\. Default is False\.
.RE
.RE
.PP
trusted
.RS 4
For security reasons, Mercurial will not use the settings in the \.hg/hgrc file from a repository if it doesn\'t belong to a trusted user or to a trusted group\. The main exception is the web interface, which automatically uses some safe settings, since it\'s common to serve repositories from different users\.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
This section specifies what users and groups are trusted\.  The
current user is always trusted\.  To trust everybody, list a user
or a group with name "*"\.
